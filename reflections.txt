  * What new skills have you learned?

  I've learned a lot of new HTML5 concepts such as figures and figcaptions.
  I learned how to quickly translate a document tree diagram into functional
  HTML in a matter of seconds. Also, I learned how to use "emmet" in Sublime
  Text 3 to quickly return correctly formatted HTML tags with quick abbreviations.

  * What has been easy?

  The basics of HTML tagging. I've learned this before.

  * What has been difficult?

  It has been difficult choosing which way to do certain tasks given that
  there are many ways to implement an idea.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  One of the lessons I learned in the first project was using my strengths as a
  support tool. Therefore, when conflicted with which method to move forward with
  a certain task, I choose to do what I know works and what I know could be implemented
  and even refactored later with relatively little time or effort.
